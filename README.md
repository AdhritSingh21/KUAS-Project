KUAS Project: Glucose Prediction Models using LSTM

This project was developed during my internship at Kyoto University, where I worked on creating predictive models for glucose levels using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. The primary goal was to develop accurate models to assist in diabetes detection and management by predicting glucose variations based on historical data.

Project Highlights:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and normalized raw data, handling various formats to ensure consistent input for modeling.
Model Development: Implemented LSTM models tailored for glucose level predictions, optimizing hyperparameters to enhance accuracy.
Technologies Used: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, VSCode, Jupyter Notebooks.
Applications: The project aimed to contribute to medical technology advancements, particularly in personalized health monitoring for diabetic patients.
Features:

Dynamic handling of data variations.
Scalable models adaptable to different datasets.
Insightful visualizations of glucose trends and model performance.
Future Work:

Integration with real-time data streams.
Deployment of the model in a user-friendly application for broader accessibility.
